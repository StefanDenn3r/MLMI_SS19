# XRay 2D Human Pose Estimation
This project was developed during the Machine Learning for Medial Imaging practical during Summer Semester 2019 which was offered by the [Chair for Computer Aided Medical Procedures & Augmented Reality (CAMP)](http://campar.in.tum.de/WebHome) from the Technical University Munich (TUM). 

The goal of this project was to implement a deep learning-based automatic registration of the human pelvis from a 2D X-Ray scans to estimate the pose of a patient and then automatically register the 3D CT scan.
Our implementations were based on the [Stacked Hourglass Network](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.06937.pdf) and the [Convolutional Pose Machines](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.00134.pdf). We applied several changes to improve the performance of the proposed networks.
